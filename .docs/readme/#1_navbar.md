# Navbar Progress Summary

## Implemented Changes
- Added a dedicated `SiteNavbar` (`resources/js/components/site-navbar.tsx`) delivering the PehliONE brand mark, Home/About/Connection/Products links, and auth-aware Login/Register or Dashboard actions. The component includes a mobile toggle drawer and reuses the shared tailwind tokens.
- Introduced a lightweight public layout (`resources/js/layouts/site-layout.tsx`) so marketing pages can mount the navbar without the authenticated sidebar shell.
- scaffolded initial Inertia views for Home, About, Connection, and Products, each adopting the new layout and copy taken from TODO requirements to make navigation targets tangible.
- Expanded `routes/web.php` with named routes (`home`, `about`, `connection`, `products`) and regenerated Wayfinder TypeScript helpers so `@/routes` exposes the new URLs for components.
- Refactored `AppLogo` to be an Inertia link that defaults to `home()`, ensuring clicks on the PehliONE wordmark (header or sidebar) always return to `http://pehlione_laravel_react.test/`.

## Commands Executed
- `npm run lint` (via `npm.cmd run lint`) to auto-format and validate the new React/TypeScript code after each major change set.
- `php artisan wayfinder:generate` to rebuild the generated route helpers and action stubs following the new web routes.
- No git commits were created; the working tree currently holds the navbar implementation changes as tracked modifications.

## Next Considerations
- Replace placeholder copy with production-ready content once product APIs, contact endpoints, and inventory data are wired up.
- If roles need unique menus, source navbar link definitions from server-side shared props or a dedicated configuration endpoint.
- Align spacing/colour tokens with the broader design system when Tailwind theme customisation is finalised.
